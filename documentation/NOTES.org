* ISSUE Multiple runtimes

If we're having multiple languages, then each language must define its own
runtime. But how do we manage all of these different runtimes when building?

Currently every module is parameterised on a root runtime. The root runtime
provides a =selectRuntime(languageIdentifier)= method, that's called to
choose the runtime for that module, and it's up to the root runtime to
figure out how to translate these language identifiers to actual runtime
services.

Things that still need figuring out:

- How do we make sure that runtimes can't conflict?
- Should we have the language describe which runtime it's using? Do we support this in Core?
